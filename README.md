### Directory Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- macos
|- test
|- web
|- windows
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- data/
|- domain/
|- presentation/
|- shared/
|- main.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1 - data - Contains the data layer of project, includes directories for local, network and shared pref/cache.
2 - domain - Contains abstraction and business logic of project, includes models, responses, request, etc.
3 - presentation - Contains all the ui of project, contains sub directory for each screen.
4 - shared - Contains the utilities/common functions, styles of application.
5 - main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.
```
